Welcome to my internet home.

This is a [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) site with some minor tailoring. This will be the home of my (likely rare) blog posts. I'd also love to build front ends for a some half project-y odds and ends I've accumulated. Front end work is pretty new to me, so this is an ambitious goal!

The setup for this website was delightfully easy and beginner friendly. If you're looking to build a site and don't have much experience, I highly recommend checking it out.
