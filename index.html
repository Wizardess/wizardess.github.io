  <p>
    If you are a dreamer, come in, <br>
    If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar, <br>
    A hope-er, a pray-er, a magic bean buyer... <br>
    If you're a pretender, come sit by my fire <br>
    For we have some flax-golden tales to spin. <br>
    Come in! <br>
    Come in! <br>
    &mdash; Shel Silverstein, <em>Invitation</em>
